# Aeterna
## Your Eternal Record

A part of you will remain in this world, long after you die. Parts of your record will live on, kept in the records that are currently owned and maintained by the world's largest data companies. Your photos are on Facebook and Instagram's servers, and all your accounts are disparately spread across many-numbered servers, which are in the hands of decision-makers that must do what is right for the financial health of their companies. That means, there is a very good chance that our living record will not persist. For some people (and some data), this makes perfect sense; however, for those pieces of your data that you feel most represent you, your time on this Earth, your life's work perhaps, the time you spent with your family... anything you find is important enough to outlive you... This is why we have created Aeterna.

### Vaults of Memory
Create a Vault to store any data you would like to outlive you. Select which data will remain eternally-public, and create "rooms" for specific people to keep the rest. Craft a room specifically for your immediate family members, and fill it with special memories, important estate-related information, and more. Set an expiration, if you want certain bits of data to be removed from the record at a given time. Give certain permissions to certain accounts, or lock your Vault to changes for eternity. 

# Caretakers and Catacombs: Distributed and Decentralized Vault Maintainers
Anyone can host a Vault on behalf of the creator. Once a Vault is created, it can be hosted by anyone who chooses to keep it alive. "Catacombs" are the term for computers which maintain Vaults, which are maintained by "Caretakers". A Catacomb Caretaker is incentivized to maintain the Vaults by receiving payouts in the form of "Offerings", explained below. 

#### Offerings: Incentivizing Vault Maintenance for Eternity
Receive Offerings at your Vault, which are evenly-distributed to Caretakers that keep a copy of your Vault alive in their Catacomb. Caretakers will receive a network-consensus-determined amount, for each KB they maintain. For example, a 10GB vault, with a network-set incentive at 1 Sat per KB, would receive 10M Sats at a set interval of time, from that Vault's specific Offering Bowl. If the Offering Bowl cannot distribute this amount in full to all Caretakers, then the remaining amount will be distributed to all Caretakers evenly.
